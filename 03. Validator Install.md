## Validator install using Lighthouse Client

https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/testnet-holesky-validator/step-5-installing-validator/installing-validator/lighthouse

 Create a service user for the validator service and create data directories.

```bash
sudo adduser --system --no-create-home --group validator
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/lighthouse/validators
```

Import your validator keys by importing your keystore file. Be sure to enter your keystore password correctly.

```bash
sudo lighthouse account validator import \
  --testnet-dir /etc/ephemery \
  --datadir /var/lib/lighthouse \
  --directory=$HOME/Downloads/ethstaker_deposit-cli-66054f5-linux-amd64/validator_keys \
  --reuse-password
```

Verify that your keystore file was imported successfully.

```bash
sudo lighthouse account_manager validator list \
  --testnet-dir /etc/ephemery \
  --datadir /var/lib/lighthouse
```

Setup ownership permissions, including hardening the access to this directory.

```bash
sudo chown -R validator:validator /var/lib/lighthouse/validators
sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/lighthouse/validators
```

Create a systemd unit file to define your ```validator.service``` configuration.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/validator.service
```

Paste the following configuration into the file. 

```bash

- If you wish to customize a graffiti message that is included when you produce a block, add your message between the double quotes after --graffiti. Maximum length is 16 characters.

To exit and save, press ```Ctrl``` + ```X```, then ```Y```, then ```Enter```.

Run the following to enable auto-start at boot time.
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable validator
```

Finally, start your validator client and check it's status.

```bash
sudo systemctl start validator
sudo systemctl status validator
```

Check your logs to confirm that the validator clients are up and functioning.

```bash
sudo journalctl -fu validator | ccze
```
